<p>
In this project IMDB dataset from kaggle is used and all analytics operations are performed around it. We began with reading data, cleaning it for operations.

<p>
We have analyzed data of movies in 10 years (2006-2016), we have been through ratings, directors, revenue and votings as well. We got some useful outputs from
this dataset such as how ratings affect the revenue and many more.

<p>
Data visualization is also performed so that the data can easily be interpreted and understood.
Visualization makes it more interesting as well.
